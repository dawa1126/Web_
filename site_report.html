		<h2>Report</h2><br><br>
		This module was very new to me as i had zero knowledge about it. But after joining the classes and learning about the module, i find it very interesting.Starting from command line to text editer coding was fun. Making a directory and changing between the directories was interesting to me. From learning the basic html elements to being able to use html for making a web page was a quiet an achievement for me. For me, designing part is the best and most interesting part to do.But frankly speaking, i was having quiet a trouble understanding and learing the process at the beginning. since, i didnt have proper knowledge about this , it was bit confusing and hard to undersatnd for me at the beginning. Even though, i attended every classes i was really confused how to use the things i learnt and stuffs. But with help of module leader and friends , i was able to understand how to do it properly.After practising more and more it became more convinient .
		In this subject, i also studied about the Git hub and about creating repository. This part was much more difficult to me. I had very hard time understanding its uses, functions and how it works. Thanks to the revision classes, due to this class i was able to understand deeply about git push, git commit,git pull and why it is done.<br><br><br>

		So in this website i have used different properties and designs.
		As for the Homepage(Index page) i have kept it very minimal putting just a tagline to make it welcoming. And, for the background i have kept minimal pink color and bluish grey color for the menu which is same for all the pages. I have kept menu at the top right of the page and have given the title Homepage.<br><br>
		Similarly, for the portfolio page i have the same background, menu and layout as index page. In this page i have used columns and dummy images. I was able to get the dummy images from the website called 'placeholder.com'. Since, i dont have any work experience, i have just kept the dummy images that are supposed to be removed by my work later.<br><br>
		For the contact page, i have used 'form action'and 'input types' to display my contact details. Same background format has been carried out in this page as well. I was able to get the colors of my like for the page from 'W3schools.com'.<br><br>
		For CV page also i have used columns to design this page. I also have used my own profile photo for this page including my name and qualification.<br><br>
		And lastly for this page, i have used columns as well as kept the screenshots of validation reports as per the requirement. i have linked all the pages i visited and took the help from. i have also mentioned about my own experience about this subject and journry of my learning process.<br><br>
